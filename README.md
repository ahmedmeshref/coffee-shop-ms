# Coffee Shop Managment System Full Stack

The system is designed for setting up the menu experience of a digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard.

The application does:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
